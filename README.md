## Overview 🔍

This project is intended for educational purposes as part of a Data Structures course. It covers classic data structure implementations and relevant algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees, Heaps, and Tries (coming soon)
- Graphs (with Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Custom examples and explorations

## Features ⚡

- Python implementations of common data structures.
- Example scripts showcasing usage and features.
- Simple CLI for interacting with graph algorithms.
- Reports and explanations in Markdown format.
